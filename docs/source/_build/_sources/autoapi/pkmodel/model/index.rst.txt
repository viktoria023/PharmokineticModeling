.. py:class:: Model(value, Q_p1=1.0, V_c=1.0, V_p1=1.0, CL=1.0, X=1.0, k_a=None, stop=None, scheme=None, tps=None)

   A Pharmokinetic (PK) model

   Parameters
   ----------

   value:  numeric, an example parameter to test if class can be called correctly
   Q_p1:   [mL/h] float, the transition rate between central compartment and peripheral compartment 1
   V_c:    [mL] float, the volume of the central compartment
   V_p1:   [mL] float, the volume of the first peripheral compartment
   CL:     [mL/h] float, the clearance/elimination rate from the central compartment
   X:      [ng] float, the amount of drug administered per injection
   k_a:     [/h] float is the absorption rate, only used for the sc dosing
   scheme: ['clt','hlt','dt'] pattern of dose administration as specified by user. clt = instantaneous limited time, hlt = hourly limited time, dt = defined time points
   stop:   [h] float, timepoint at which injection stops. Only used in 'ilt' and 'hlt' scheme
   tps:    [h] float, timepoints of dose administration as specified by the user. Only used in 'dt' scheme

   .. py:method:: dose(t, self)

      Definition of dosing scheme
      Depending on the defined dosing scheme, the function determines the released dosage X
      at the  specified timepoint. 

      Parameters
      ___________
      t: [h] float, timepoint tested by dose function

      :returns: float, amount of drug released at the specified timepoint t


   .. py:method:: ivModel(t, y, self)

      Setting up intravenous model
      Sets up 2-compartment model 

      Parameters
      ___________
      t: [h] float, current timepoint 
      y: [ng, ng] list, current amount of drug in the compartments

      :returns: list with change of drug concentrations in respective compartments as a derivative of the time


   .. py:method:: scModel(t, y, self)

      Setting up subcatenous model
      Sets up 3-compartment model, with inital compartment giving off the drug to the central compartment at rate k_a

      Parameters
      ___________
      t: [h] float, current timepoint 
      y: [ng, ng, ng] list, current amount of drug in the compartments

      :returns: list with change of drug concentrations in respective compartments as a derivative of the time
